* Use http://127.0.0.1/mediawiki-1.16.0/api.php?action=query&prop=templates&titles=109%2C901
  to figure out what templates are being used on a given page, and then
  translate them to page includes.  This can be done for templates without
  arguments.
  
  The API doesn't tell us whether or not a template has arguments,
  but we can accomplish this by rendering the template and comparing the
  resulting HTML to the HTML inside the rendered page.  If it's identical,
  then we know we can replace it with an include.
